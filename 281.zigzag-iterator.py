# Testcase Example:  '[1,2]\n[3,4,5,6]'
#
# Given two 1d vectors, implement an iterator to return their elements
# alternately.
#
# Example:
#
#
# Input:
# v1 = [1,2]
# v2 = [3,4,5,6]
#
# Output: [1,3,2,4,5,6]
#
# Explanation:Â By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns
# false,
# the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,3,2,4,5,6].
#
# Follow up: What if you are given k 1d vectors? How well can your code be
# extended to such cases?
#
# Clarification for the follow up question:
# The "Zigzag" order is not clearly defined and is ambiguous for k > 2 cases.
# If "Zigzag" does not look right to you, replace "Zigzag" with "Cyclic". For
# example:
#
#
# Input:
# [1,2,3]
# [4,5,6,7]
# [8,9]
#
# Output: [1,4,8,2,5,9,3,6,7].
