#
# Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest
# consecutive elements sequence.
#
# Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
#
# Example:
#
#
# Input:Â [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].
# Therefore its length is 4.
